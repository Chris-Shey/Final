This coding implements a Traveling Salesman problem solver where the goal is to go through all possible paths visiting all cities once then the program finds the shortest most cost-efficient path starting from Riverside.  This program works with a small set of cities and the travel costs are provided as an adjacency matrix.  This program outputs all possible trips and their associated costs, along with the best trip and it's total costs.  For this program, my approach involved relying on Adjacney Matric to represent all the different paths to the different cities and the costs of travel from one to the other.  

Basic instructions
The cities and the travel costs are already defined in the adjacency matrix.  Just run the program and it would display first the adjacency matrix, then all possible paths starting from riverside with their costs, then finally the most efficient trip and its total cost.
